1. Use a javascript library or framework to upgrade the trades table to be a searchable and sortable grid. Smaple options are SlickGrid, DataTables, UI-Grid. Explain why you pick the library you do. 
2. Add a project to the solution for unit tests, add NUnit to the project, and add a unit test to verify that the GetTrades() method of the TradeRepository actually returns 500 rows. 
3. BONUS: Add a WebApi controller that returns the trades via JSON. Modify the trades view to populate the new grid via an AJAX get request.
